## React Boilerplate
[`react-boilerplate`](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) is a web development template project that provides a rich, [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) development experience powered by sane configurations and tool selections. Powered by a number of build tools including [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and many, React.js frameworks and technologies such as [`react-helmet`](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/).

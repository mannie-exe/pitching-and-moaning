# Pitching and Moaning ðŸ§ 

![see project_root://docs/design/poster-graphic_v1_export.png](docs/design/poster-graphic_v1_export.png)

## Poster Design Study
Features of the current design, as used on the [current website](https://pitchingandmoaning.com/) and presumably the poster:

* Strong frame
* Great movement
* 3-layers of distance
* Expressive; polarizing

The pillars going up along the side meld with the title text at the top to give the impression of a Greco-Roman pediment. The subject â€” the man in the middle â€” himself is placed over waves crashing in the background with thunder (quite oddly) crackling down a stormy, purple sky.

![the poster is in an empty, white page](docs/design/poster-graphic_v1_website-usage.png)

The minimalist white of the webpage creates a striking and effective form of contrast compared to the lavishly neon colors and variant, expressive lineart.

## Tasks
### [Category: Prep]
* Clean-up lightning
	- That's not how lightning works
	- Original fits composition
	- (but I can find another way that looks nice)
* "Fix" shadows and highlights
	- Waves and character have minimal shadows/highlights
	- Simplicity fits this medium better
	- (but it almost seems unfinished)
* Mess with the colors a little
	- They're beautiful as they are, to be honest
* (very optional) maybe redraw the pillars, text, and base
	- right now all three are just put on top of each other

### [Category: Animation]
* Break-apart the background wave
	- 2-3 pieces should be enough
	- Animate each piece on it's own
	- (to emulate crashing of the waves)
* Lightning doesn't have to be static
	- Could strike occassionally and randomly
	- Since it comes and goes:
        + it could also "wash" intense white light for a brief second
* Waving hoodie strings ðŸŒ¬
* Give the teardrop some twinkles ðŸ˜¢âœ¨
* Possible other, similarly tiny embellishments

### [Category: Interaction]
* Character's eyes maniacally follow the mouse cursor
	- (you know he'd be curious)
* Play button drops on character's head
	- to indicate "click here for video"
	- when user hovers on the imagerk
	- when user hovers on the text below the image
		+ (that asks if you wanna watch the pilot episode)
* Bring parallax/depth to the layers
    - Bind to mouse/gyro movement

## Next-Up!!
I'd like to create at least two releases of the site: to finish the first version, I must:

* Clean-up lightning [\[Category: Prep\]](#category-prep)
* Break-up waves [\[Category: Animation\]](#category-animation)
* Bind eye-to-mouse movement [\[Category: Interaction\]](#category-interaction)

...this way, I'd have implemented the *\~most\~* useful aspect from each category.

The finally version simply does it all (or most).
